She was friendly, happy, a generally nicve person. She was a little fidgety while I was asking questions and 
during the cash doors game - playing with the pen or boucing her foot. She had trouble thinking of adjectives to 
describe the setting, people, or actions during the interview and could not answer those questions. 

I messed up in the instructions a little bit for the first interview (general impressions). I said all of the 
correct phrases, just not in the correct order.

Participant was nice, easy going. Had a few questions about "how do I know which door to choose?" but other than 
that everything went smoothly. He was also very conscientoius about making sure he did the tasks correctly (example: 
answering in enough detail during the interview). Curious about how the video related to the doors at the end of
the study as well.

Tested by Kiera.

PANAS was given out at the beginning of the experiment (oops).

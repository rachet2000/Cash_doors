She was a bit late, so came in very rushed/frazzled. At the beginning, she also seemed rushed because she spoke 
very quickly and as soon as I finished the first part of the cash doors game isntructions outlining how to select 
a door, she put her fingers on the arrows and was "ready to go". She became less rushed as the study progressed.

She was very detailed in the episodic interview, I had to cut her off as she began to describe the actions in the 
video. She also said a lot (about 6 minutes worth) during the general memory interview. 

At the end, she was extemely curois about how the experiment worked and what her memory/risk taking said about her 
as a person. I passed along the link to the original cash doors study, so hopefully that will quench her curiosity.

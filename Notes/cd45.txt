This participant did not pay too much attention to the videos or to the instructions -- I had to tell him twice 
to fill out the PANAS questionnaire and to start the cash doors game after reading the instructions on the screen. 
He said that he thought I told him not to write anything (for the PANAS). He also recalled very few details 
during the episodic interview. It was difficult to meet the 4 minute time mark and I had to ask lots of follow-up 
questions for both interviews.

He thought the Mr. Bean videos were hilarious, which was nice to see a participant really excited by that content.

At the end of the study he told me I looked nice and that we should meet up sometime... (awkward). I hope that he 
did not alter the results of the study trying to impress me or something like that.

Tested by Kiera.

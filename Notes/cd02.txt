She was motivated to do the tasks correctly.

Unfortunately, her episodic interview lasted 12 minutes. I did not interrupt her and she just kept talking.
She finished a bit late and there was another participant afterward, so I asked her to draw the second set of doors
in another room so the other participant could watch the first video.

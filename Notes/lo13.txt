Participant asked lots of questions including what kinds of questions I would interview him about, what if he did
not choose a door, how he should decide which door to choose, if his drawings provided enough detail, etc. He said 
he was very intersted in psychology and we talked for a while after the experiment finished about what was being 
tested and the results.Very nice and very intersted. 

Tested by Kiera.

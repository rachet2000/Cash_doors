She was motivated to do the tasks correctly.

I was tired and it was my first experiment in a while; my english was a bit broken and I did not say the scripts 
perfectly, however she still understood the instructions correctly.

She was quite nervous during the general interview (second part). 
She pressed the next button after the first part of cash doors game; for this reason, the first few trials
are a bunch of "too slow". We will have to delay the trial numbers accordingly, and make sure she still
received the first rewards the right way.

The participant was a little shy, by friendly. She thought it was a bit funny when I repeated the instructions
ex: "I have not seen the video myself, so you are the expert". She seemed like an "average" participant.

There were no PANAS's in the room, so I conducted the experiment without them. Everything else went smoothly. I 
hope this does not impact the results.

Particiapant had to reschedule, and was grateful that we could meet her to do the study. She was a few minutes
late, and made a comment again about how she was happy we could accomodate her. She rushed through the consent 
form without reading (maybe because she was a bit late?). She talked about the actions during the surroundings 
question (epsodic interview) and was very detailed.

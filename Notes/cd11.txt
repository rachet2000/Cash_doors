She was tired and apparently had to cancel plans with her friend (for the study? idk)

At the beginning she was texting, so I asked her to not text. She then explained to me it was because
she had to communicate with her friend about plan cancellations. I told her she could respond to her 
in the middle of the experiment, after the first cash door game. 
Hence, there was approximately 1 minute after drawing the doors where she texted to her friend.
I then had her wait an extra 2 minutes to be sure there was enough time between the videos.

She did not look very motivated to do the tasks, but it might be because she was shy.
She did not look like a very good participant, but there is way worse.


I think the interview did not go as well as it could have, but it was still alright.
At the end I asked her if the first drawing was the best she could remember about the doors; she told me that yes.
She also told me that throughout the experiment she thought she would receive 1.25 and 2.5 dollars per trial;
and was confused since this was an unrealistic amount.

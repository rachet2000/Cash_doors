He was willing to do the tasks correctly, but this person was extremely laidback.
At some point I believe he was not taking the tasks very seriously. But I believe he did the best he could.
For example his position was nearly horizontal during both cash doors games. I should have told him to sit straight,
but I did not do it for the first part so I decided not to do it in the second as well.

I do not feel like he tried as hard as he could have in the episodic interview. His descriptions were rather general
and he did not seem to remember a lot about the scenes. When he described the actions he did so in a somewhat random
order.
He put his "tuque" over his eyes when I asked you to close his eyes.

He was surprised and happy about having to watch a Mr.Bean video.

I did the general interview with my computer since I could not find the sheet. He arrived in advance and I had 
to go print the consent form and PANAS, so we started on time at the end.

Before the cash doors game, he asked me to confirm if he could not loose money. I told him he could not.

He said that he realized in the second part that one door was always giving zero, so he stopped using it.

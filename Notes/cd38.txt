This participant was very fidgety during the cash doors game, but not as much while he was watching the video.
During the game, he checked his phone, sang/hummed, looked around the room, and played with the wire on the table
for the audio recorder. He bounced his leg for the entire duration of the study.

He seemed to be in a rush as he was filling out the questionnaires.

Tested by Kiera.

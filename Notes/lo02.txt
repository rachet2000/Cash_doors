This participant showed up 15 minutes early, so I was not quite ready when he arrived. He seemed a bit irritable at
first, but warmed up to me during the interview. He seemed to understand the new instructions clearly for the loss
cash doors game. He was curious about the study after it had finished, especially how the task was randomized. He
said he picked the door he thought was nicer and wondered if that was factored in to how to the results.


PANAS was given out at the beginning of the experiment (oops).

She was motivated to do the tasks correctly.
She was pretty tense, our first greeting was a bit awkward.

She said that the interviews stressed her out because the questions were more difficult than expected.
Throughout the experiment she looked a bit stressed and like she wasn't sure as to whether she was doing the 
right thing.
She looked a bit bored during the cash doors.

At the end she told me she was choosing 'randomly' for about 60% of the first set.
What she more precisely meant by that is that she only realized that one choice was safe and the other was risky
after about 60 trials.  
She said she was still paying attention to the rewards. I looked at her data and she is risk averse even after
20 trials, so I assume there is nothing to worry about.

However, we might want to confirm after looking at the analysis.

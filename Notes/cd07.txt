Since the previous participant finished late, she had to wait a bit before starting.
She completed the consent form and did the PANAS in the waiting room.

She seemed motivated to do the tasks correctly.
She had a tendency to choose the safe option but did not plateau.
She was a bit shy but not too much. I was tired (4th participant in the day) and was maybe a bit too formal with her
But everything went well

She was motivated to do the tasks correctly

This was Nicholas' first participant. David was shadowing him.
We started a bit late (about 20 minutes) because the computer hadn't been restarted in a while.

***I (David) had forgotten to change the number of trials back to 100. She did 20 trials on both sessions.
For this reason, we had to exclude the participant from the analysis. 

During the action part of the episodic interview, the talked solely about the feelings of the characters, rather
than the actions.

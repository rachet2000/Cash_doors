She was shy, but I think she was motivated to do the tasks correctly.

The second interview, the episodic one, did not go as well as usual. She was not very specific.
At the beginning I was driven by habits, but I realized I should ask her more detailed questions at some point.
Overall it went well and she was specific about the actions, but not so much about the environment/people.

I had her wait 3 minutes after demographic for the 20 minutes in between two videos.

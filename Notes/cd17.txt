She was motivated to do the tasks correctly.

She had missed her appointment the day before. She came earlier this morning because I accidently send her a 
reminder for today.
When she first came in the morning, I rescheduled her for later in the evening.

She was nice. She had some trouble describing the surroundings at the beginning. She started with the 
actions, but at some point I rectified her. It became better when we moved to people and actions.
Overall it was fine, just not perfect.

I was maybe a bit too friendly with her; I realized halfway and adopted a more neutral attitude.
It was my 5th participant straight on that day, so I was a bit tired. Still did the best I could.

At the end she asked for the purpose of the study and said one of the reasons she participated was because
she was interested in seeing how psychological experiments are like.
It was her first psychology study.

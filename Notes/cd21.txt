She was very sick.

She was a bit tired because she was sick I think. She wouldn't stop coughing and sneezing.
She seemed motivated to do the tasks correctly.

I was a bit sleep-deprived and tired that day; for that reason I was a bit more rigid than usual.
I did my best to be the same as usual. I was back to normal in the second half.

However I still really hate it when participants are sick. I should put some lysol on the equipment before
the next participant comes.

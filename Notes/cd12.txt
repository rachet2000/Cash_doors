He was motivated to do the tasks correctly. He was a bit in advance and had to wait a bit before starting.

I kind of messed up the episodic interview; I stopped halfway through the instructions to search for the right sheet.
I think that confused him; this might be why he first started to describe the surroundings of when he entered the 
experiment. I quickly corrected him.
Overall, the interview did not go as well as it could have been, especially the surroundings and people parts.
It was not that bad but far from perfect; sometimes he mentionned recalls that were not very detailed or precise.
The action part was ideal.

He was not a native english speaker; his english was good, but sometimes he had problems understanding me if I
spoke too fast.
I had to speak a bit slower and more clearly, and then he understood me perfectly fine.

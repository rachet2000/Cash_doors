He was motivated to do the tasks correctly.

However there were some minor issues with the interviews;
In the episodic interview for the surroundings, he started describing the actions in details at some point.

In the general interview, he began by focusing a lot on details. I told him twice to switch to more general
impressions, but he was still vaguely describing what happened. So at some point I interrupted him and went ahead
with the other questions. 


I had tossed a coin and it landed on the general interview first, but since I was missing the sheet and did not have
my computer I went for the episodic interview first instead. This isn't ideal but should not change anything.

I had met her in my previous experiment in the Ostry lab, and I remembered not liking her as a participant.

She was there for the money, but still tried to be as nice as possible. I feel like sometimes she has problems
following complicated instructions; for examples she started telling me the story of the video when I asked
her for the surroundings. 
Maybe that I rectified her a bit too much in the episodic interview; since she tended to state general information,
I repeatdly asked her to focus on details. She was mostly for the surroudings, I rectified her a bit in the people
and the actions went perfectly fine.

I do not believe she was doing this out of bad will; I think she was motivated to do the tasks correctly.
But maybe more focused on simply going through the experiment and getting the money.

This hang with the episodic induction aside, everything went pretty well. 

I think she was a bit unlucky in the cash door game, I might be mistaken though.

She was motivated to do the tasks correctly. Good participant.

I arrived 1-2 minutes late.

There was a small issue: When I first introduced the video to her, I mentionned the video and the fact
I would be asking her questions afterward. However, I put too much emphasis on the questions (mentionned an interview)
, and she catched up to the fact she was supposed the remember the videos. She asked me if she should be 
taking notes while she was going to be watching the video or anything.

I did not know which condition she was going to be in when this happened. But when I tossed the coin, she happened
to be in the episodic condition.
I think she tried to remember as many details as she could while watching the video; this would explain
the unusual amount of details she reported in the interview.

I do not think this is enough of a reason to exclude her; however the episodic manipulation might have been
stronger than usual. 

At the end she asked what the study was about.

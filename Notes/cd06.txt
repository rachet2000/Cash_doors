I looked at her and I am pretty sure she plateau - she always chose the safe option, for both cash door games.

She was slower than the average participant and took 1h15 minutes to finish the experiment.
She was formal and a bit shy but a nice person.
When she was responding to the probability questions, I thought there might have been an issue with the door order 
and interrupted to ask her if the doors were in the same order as before. She said yes.

He looked motivated to do the tasks correctly. However, he was easily distracted.
At the beginning he kept looking at his phone whenever he had a second; I then asked him to refrain from looking
at his phone. 
During the cash door game, he got distracted by the receipt sheet. 

After the first cash door game and the drawing/demographic, I had him wait about 3 minutes in order
to have at least 20 minutes in between the end of the first and the beginning of the second video.

He laughed a lot during the first video.

He seemed very nervous, and socially awkward. I did my best to be friendly so he would be comfortable.
Seemed like a nice person, and he seemed motivated to do the tasks correctly.
He stands out as a person; I hope this will not affect the results.


Tested by David.
The experiment went well in general.

I think she was motivated to do the tasks correctly, but I am not 100% sure.

She seemed a bit weird. Her responses were always short and straightforward; she was not very responsive or talkative.
She responded to me, just in a short and brief way. I think she was still focused and trying to do well.
I do not think it is because of the experiment but just because she is like that in general. It was a bit
awkward in general, but I did my best do act the same way as usual.

Her behavior on the cash door game looked fine and she tried in the interviews, so maybe I am worried over nothing.

Just in general, this person behave a bit atypicaly. In the end I think she wanted to do well.
She seemed glad that I was nice to her after the study.



She is a graphic designer, so no surprise her drawings are very good.

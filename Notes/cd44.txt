This participant was easy going, but also a little bit shy. She was very curious at the end of the experiment 
about the results and how the experiment worked. 

She also spoke a lot in both sets of post-video questions - I had to cut her off in the episodic portion and 
she spoke for about 6 minutes in the general portion. She started to tell about details in the general portion, 
so I stopped her.

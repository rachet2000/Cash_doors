This was Kiera's second participant

I did not exlpain to her in details how the cash doors game works. When the instructions for the memory task 
appeared, she thought the first part was over. She continued to the second part.

When she restarted the cash doors game, it was over in 2-3 minutes (the participant did the memory tasks instead).
She thought the program had a problem and just finished the experiment. 


**Technically, everything up to the first memory task is usable.

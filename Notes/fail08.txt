She was motivated to do the tasks correctly.
At the beginning I was a bit stressed because 1.the computer was not working and 2.I was missing the recorder.
However, both of these problems were fixed in no time.

The reason I excluded her is because the program crashed halfway through the first cash doors game (after 7 minutes)
This happened because I opened the program directly, and not via Idle. 

I made her redo the first part, but after it was over I decided to exclude her and that
it was not worth to waste her time any further.

She was motivated to do the tasks correctly.

Once again I was tired today.I acted a bit differently but did the best I could.

After the first video, there was a short delay due to the fact I could not find the sheet anymore. 
I used my computer instead. There maybe was 1 minute before the interview began.

After the second video, there was another delay, due to the fact I had not noticed she was done (I am tired
please forgive me). I asked her at the end, and she told me she had to wait approximately 30 seconds.

During the first interview, she mentionned she could not figure out why she was watching this. At the end
she revealed she tried to figure out what the experiment was about but couldn't.
She asked what the purpose of the experiment was at the end of the study.

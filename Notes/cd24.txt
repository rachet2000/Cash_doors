I think he was motivated to do the tasks correctly.
Very formal guy.

At the beginning of the study he asked whether our mirror was a one-sided one. I told him this was the case,
so I could know when he is done with something.

Before the first video, he asked if this was the task where he could gain the 5$ bonus.

It was my first participant today and he was very formal compared to others, so possibly that my behavior was
a bit unusual. But I do not think it was that bad. 

At the end I had to make him write the receipt on a white sheet of paper, as we were missing the usual form.

*After receiving his first drawing I asked him if that was really all he could remember. I am a bad scientist I am 
sorry, I just wanted to make sure he understood the instructions properly.
Maybe that gave him extra motivation to draw them right the second time idk.

I prompted him a lot about extra information in the episodic interview, compared to other participants.
I should have done so more specifically rather than asking if he could remember something else about the scene.

First loss participant was very easy going. She was curious about the experiment after it had finished (she was 
also a researcher) and we talked about the study for ~10 minutes. She seemed to understand the instructions clearly,
especially with mentioning how a participant will lose money twice during the instructions. She seemed motivated 
to do the task correctly as well.

Tested by Kiera.

PANAS was given out at the beginning and the end of the experiment (oops).

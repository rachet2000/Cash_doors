She was late by 25 minutes.

She did not seem super motivated, but she did the tasks correctly.

I was silly enough to do analysis for Dasha's experiment at the same time: for this reason, I sometimes noticed
late when she either finished the videos or the cash door task.
I was not there when she was about to finish the first cash door task: she clicked continue, and I asked her not
to press anything for the first few trials.

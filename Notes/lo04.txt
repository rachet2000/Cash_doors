Participant seemed a bit jittery at the beginning of the experiment. The doors he drew after the cash door game had
very little detail and were basically just boxes. He seemed to understand everything well. He did not have any 
questions at the end and commented on how it was a nice/fast way to earn some money.

Tested by Kiera.

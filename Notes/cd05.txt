I think he was motivated to do the tasks correctly.

It was hard to make eye contact with him; however he seemed to relax during the first interview (general).
He clearly was here for the money.
He did not seem very motivated, but I think he took the experiment seriously. It might just have been his mood
or his character. 

When asked to describe the experiment, he said it was quite straightforward.

He is the first participant to whom I gave the post-experiment PANAS, on Dr.Sheldon's recommendation.

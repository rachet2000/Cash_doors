This was Kiera's first participant (cd35x is second participant)

There are two things that seemed to have gone wrong during this experiment

1. He did not press keys during the second session (too slows). At some point the message to go faster appeared
on the screen. I did not warn Kiera this could happen; she thought it was a glitch and went to the next part
of the experiment (to be fair, a glitch seemed to have happened with her friend 2 days ago).

2. The participant always chose the safe option for the first 70 trials (except once).

**The data up for the first session should have been usable. However, I think this participant is an outlier.
